# Radon

[![Latest Version on Packagist][ico-version]][link-packagist]
[![Total Downloads][ico-downloads]][link-downloads]
[![Build Status][ico-travis]][link-travis]

A library like [Carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon) but for Iranian (Jalali) calendar

## Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require wamadev/radon
```

## Usage

### Create new instance
Just like when you would do `now()` and get a Carbon instance, you can do `jnow()` and get a Radon instance for the current time.

To make a new instance based on the given datetime, you can use `radon($datetimeString)` like:
`$r = radon('1401-12-28 06:15')`
and get a new instance for that datetime

### Conversions

To convert Carbon instances to Radon instances, do:
```
$carbonInstance->toJalali(); // returns Radon instance and converts the date from gregorian to jalali
```

To do the vice versa (Radon to Carbon), do:
```
$radonInstance->toGregorian(); // returns Carbon instance and converts the date from jalali to gregorian
```

### Methods

You can use most of the carbon's methods on a Radon instance. e.g. `$radonInstance->diffForHumans()`, `$radonInstance->addDay(10)`, `$radonInstance->setDay(1)`

### Eloquent / Querying

Radon introduces new querying features for Jalali dates. Available methods are:

#### whereBetweenJalali 
Note that this method is also available on `Collection` objects.

Example:
```php
Product::whereBetweenJalali('created_at', [radon('1398-10-12'), radon('1398-11-12')])->get();
```

#### orWhereBetweenJalali
This method is like `orWhereBetween` but for Jalali dates.

#### whereDateJalali
```php
Comment::whereDateJalali('created_at', radon('1400-01-01'))->get(); // Gets all the comments for first day of 1400
```

#### whereDayJalali
Compares the day
```php
Comment::whereDayJalali('created_at', 31); // Gets all comments for 31th
```

#### whereMonthJalali
Compares the month
```php
Comment::whereMonthJalali('created_at', 1); // Gets all of Farvardin's comments
```

#### whereYearJalali
Compares the year
```php
Comment::whereYearJalali('created_at', 1400); // Gets all of 1400's comments
```

### Casts

You can use the Radon cast to make the conversion process easier. To use the cast, add the cast to your field in the respective model:

```php
use Wama\Radon\Casts\JalaliDatetime;

class Product extends Model {
  protected $casts = [
    'sales_ends_at' => JalaliDatetime::class,
    'updated_at' => JalaliDatetime::class,
    'created_at' => JalaliDatetime::class,
  ];  
}
```
and get a Radon instance every time you get the field. 
`$product->sales_ends_at // returns a Radon instance`

you can also update the model without having to worry about the datetime conversions:
```php
$product->update([
  'sales_ends_at' => radon('1401-01-14 23:00'), // Sales will end at Farvardin 14th
]);
```
or 
```php
$product->sales_ends_at->addMonth();
$product->save();
```

## Expansion

Radon tries to support most of the Carbon methods, but keep in mind that some of the Carbon methods are not supported _yet_ and might be added in the next versions.
This package uses [Verta](https://github.com/hekmatinasser/verta) under the hood and therefore, expanding some functionalities might demand on the expansion of Verta.
